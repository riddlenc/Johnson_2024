Part 1: Setup

Load the required libraries and set the theme
``` {r}
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(tibble)
library(ARTool)
theme_set(theme_classic())
```

Set your working directory and load the data file.
``` {r}
## as long as the script and data files are in the same folder, here is sufficient.
library(here)
## set working directory
##setwd("/Users/heidijohnson/Documents/data/QMR")

## load data 
data <- read_excel("QMR_master.xlsx", sheet = "master")

## Set the independent variables to factors
data$genotype <- as.factor(data$genotype)
data$sex <- as.factor(data$sex)
data$timepoint <- as.factor(data$timepoint)
data$treatment <- as.factor(data$treatment)
```

Age is expected to impact body condition, so isolate each timepoint independently to discover is there is a significant treatment effect at any of the investagted ages.
``` {r}
## t1 is 10 days old, t2 is 25 days old, t3 is 40 days old
timepoint1 <- subset(data, timepoint=="t1")
timepoint2 <- subset(data, timepoint=="t2")
timepoint3 <- subset(data, timepoint=="t3")
```

Part 2: Fat:lean mass ratio

This script is used to analyze the QMR data on fat and lean mass (from QMR). This approach compares the fat:lean mass ratio of all groups.

Data QC
```{r}
# Looking for anything odd
summary(timepoint1)
summary(timepoint2)
summary(timepoint3)

hist(timepoint1$fat_mg)
hist(timepoint2$fat_mg)
hist(timepoint3$fat_mg)

# Trying a new package for this task;
library(DataExplorer)
DataExplorer::create_report(timepoint1)

# Checking how many samples recorded a 0 fat mass
nrow(subset(timepoint1, fat_mg == 0))
nrow(subset(timepoint2, fat_mg == 0))
nrow(subset(timepoint3, fat_mg == 0))

no_fat <- subset(timepoint1, subset = fat_mg == 0)
mean(no_fat$weight_norm_mg)
with_fat <- subset(timepoint1, subset = fat_mg != 0)
mean(with_fat$weight_norm_mg)
```
Overall, the data look ok, but we have an issue with some samples giving a 0 reading for fat mass. These readings are a bit puzzling, as they occur at all timepoints, even in young females and don't seem to be linked to low weight, at least not in timepoint 1. In the other two timepoints, the animals with 0 fat readings weigh less. 

In timepoint 1, we have six 0 readings, in timepoint 2, we have 34 and in timepoint 3, we have 36. In timepoint 1, this is not a big deal (less than 10% of cases), but in timepoints 2&3, that's more than 1/3 of cases. We'll need to run the analysis a few different ways to ensure our conclusions are not driven by these cases. 

Normality test
```{r}
shapiro.test(timepoint1$fat_lean_ratio)
shapiro.test(timepoint2$fat_lean_ratio)
shapiro.test(timepoint3$fat_lean_ratio)
```
Wow, timepoint 1 is fine, but 2&3 are not normal based on this. Will test the residuals as well to be sure.

```{r}
model1 <- aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint1)
shapiro.test(model1$residuals)
model2 <- aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint2)
shapiro.test(model2$residuals)
model3 <- aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint3)
shapiro.test(model3$residuals)
```
These are all fine, so we can run a regular ANOVA and don't need to do the ART ANOVA that gives us errors. 
================================================================================
Do not use this section

Run the ranked anova for the first timepoint:
```{r}
model <- art(fat_lean_ratio ~ genotype*sex*treatment, data = timepoint1)
summary(model)
anova(model)
```
Again, the ART ANOVA gives us the warning about reliability. We will need to address that as well. 


Run the ranked anova for the second timepoint:
```{r}
model <- art(fat_lean_ratio ~ genotype*sex*treatment, data = timepoint2)
summary(model)
anova(model)
```
Again, the ART ANOVA gives us the warning about reliability. We will need to address that as well.

Run the ranked anova for the third timepoint:
```{r}
model <- art(fat_lean_ratio ~ genotype*sex*treatment, data = timepoint3)
summary(model)
anova(model)
```
Again, the ART ANOVA gives us the warning about reliability. We will need to address that as well.
End of section to skip. 
===================================================================================

#Testing for a batch effect:
kruskal.test(fat_lean_ratio ~ set, data = timepoint1)
kruskal.test(fat_lean_ratio ~ set, data = timepoint2)
kruskal.test(fat_lean_ratio ~ set, data = timepoint3)
# no batch effects

# non-parametric tests for main effects
kruskal.test(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex, data = timepoint1)

drop1(model, .~., test="F")

rm(model)
model <- lm(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=timepoint2)
drop1(model, .~., test="F")
# Reducing the model to significant factors only
rm(model)
model <- lm(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex + genotype + treatment + sex:genotype +  sex:genotype:treatment, data=timepoint2)
drop1(model, .~., test="F")

rm(model)
model <- lm(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=timepoint3)
drop1(model, .~., test="F")
# Reducing the model to significant factors only
rm(model)

#Different ANOVA as sanity check.

rm(model)
model <- aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex + genotype + treatment +sex:genotype + genotype:treatment, data=timepoint1)
TukeyHSD(model, conf.level=.95)

summary(aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=timepoint2))
# Reducing the model to significant factors only
summary(aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex + genotype + treatment + sex:genotype + sex:genotype:treatment, data=timepoint2))
rm(model)
model <- aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex + genotype + treatment + sex:genotype + sex:genotype:treatment, data=timepoint2)
TukeyHSD(model, conf.level=.95)

summary(aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=timepoint3))
# Reducing the model to significant factors only
summary(aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex + genotype + treatment + genotype:treatment, data=timepoint3))
rm(model)
model <- aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex + genotype + treatment + genotype:treatment, data=timepoint3)
TukeyHSD(model, conf.level=.95)
```
In the non-parametric tests, we only see a genotype effect, no effect of sex or treatment if we include all data. 
Results are consistent with the two ANOVA methods. We have interaction effects in all of them. 

Next, we'll make sure that these result are not driven by the 0 values in the data.
```{r}
#Different ANOVA as sanity check. 
options(contrasts=c("contr.treatment", "contr.poly")) # reset to default
summary(aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=subset(timepoint1, fat_mg !=0)))
# Reducing the model to significant factors only
summary(aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex + genotype + treatment +sex:genotype + genotype:treatment, data=subset(timepoint1, fat_mg !=0)))

summary(aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=subset(timepoint2, fat_mg !=0)))
# Reducing the model to significant factors only
summary(aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex + genotype + treatment + sex:genotype, data=subset(timepoint2, fat_mg !=0)))

summary(aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=subset(timepoint3, fat_mg !=0)))
# Reducing the model to significant factors only
summary(aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex + genotype + treatment, data=subset(timepoint3, fat_mg !=0)))
```
So, the 0 values most definitely impact the results at timepoints 2&3. Timepoint 1, we have the same results. 

Because we want to investigate immediate versus long-term effects, we can't keep timepoints 2 and 3 for the two treatments together (timepoint 1 only has one treatmnet.). Thus we need some additional analyses with subsetting.

```{r}
# Subsetting
timepoint2.5d <- subset(timepoint2, (treatment == "control" | treatment == "5d"))
timepoint2.20d <- subset(timepoint2, (treatment == "control" | treatment == "20d"))

timepoint3.5d <- subset(timepoint3, (treatment == "control" | treatment == "5d"))
timepoint3.20d <- subset(timepoint3, (treatment == "control" | treatment == "20d"))

# Normality tests
shapiro.test(timepoint2.5d$fat_lean_ratio) # not normal
shapiro.test(timepoint2.20d$fat_lean_ratio) # not normal

shapiro.test(timepoint3.5d$fat_lean_ratio) # not normal
shapiro.test(timepoint3.20d$fat_lean_ratio) # not normal

#ART ANOVA
model <- art(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint2.5d)
summary(model)
anova(model)
options(max.print = 2000)
marginal = art.con(model, "sex:genotype:treatment", adjust = "tukey")

summary(model)
anova(model)
options(max.print = 2000)
marginal = art.con(model, "sex:genotype:treatment", adjust = "tukey")
marginal
rm(model)

# ANOVA

summary(aov(fat_lean_ratio ~ sex + genotype + treatment, data=timepoint3.5d))

#############################################
Part 3: Post-hoc


Post-hoc- investigate effects or interactions that are significant at any of the ages
```{r}

## the factor should be the factor of interest
## "fat_lean_ratio"  as a character string

## specify which timepoint you are investigating 
## either timepoint1, timepoint2, or timepoint3 as an object

## set the model based on above info
model <- art(weight_norm_mg ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint3)
anova(model)
```
Based on the significant factors in the ANOVA, use a Tukey to compare the subgroups
```{r}
options(max.print = 2000)
marginal = art.con(model, "genotype:treatment", adjust = "tukey")
marginal
```
