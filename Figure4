```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Part 1: Setup

Load the required libraries and set the theme
``` {r}
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(tibble)
library(ARTool)
theme_set(theme_classic())
```

Set your working directory and load the data file.
``` {r}
## as long as the script and data files are in the same folder, here is sufficient.
library(here)
## set working directory
##setwd("/Users/heidijohnson/Documents/data/QMR")

## load data 
data <- read_excel("QMR_master.xlsx", sheet = "master")

## Set the independent variables to factors
data$genotype <- as.factor(data$genotype)
data$sex <- as.factor(data$sex)
data$timepoint <- as.factor(data$timepoint)
data$treatment <- as.factor(data$treatment)
```

Age is expected to impact body condition, so isolate each timepoint independently to discover is there is a significant treatment effect at any of the investagted ages.
``` {r}
## t1 is 10 days old, t2 is 25 days old, t3 is 40 days old
timepoint1 <- subset(data, timepoint=="t1")
timepoint2 <- subset(data, timepoint=="t2")
timepoint3 <- subset(data, timepoint=="t3")
```

Part 2: Total body weight

Testing for a batch effect:
```{r}
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ set, data = timepoint1)
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ set, data = timepoint2)
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ set, data = timepoint3)
```
No batch effects for timepoints 1 and 2, but for timepoint 3, there is a signifiant effect for set, suggesting that this factor needs to be in the model, at least to start with.

Normality tests
```{r}
shapiro.test(timepoint1$weight_norm_mg)
shapiro.test(timepoint2$weight_norm_mg)
shapiro.test(timepoint3$weight_norm_mg)

#checking residuals
model1 <- aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint1)
shapiro.test(model1$residuals)
model2 <- aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint2)
shapiro.test(model2$residuals)
model3 <- aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint3)
shapiro.test(model3$residuals)
```
Ok, none of this is normal, but we have large sample sizes, so a regular ANOVA is an option. We'll start with a rank transformed ANOVA to see how that goes. 


Run the ranked anova for the first timepoint:
```{r}
model <- art(weight_norm_mg ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint1)
summary(model)
anova(model)
```

For this dataset, the ART ANOVA gives a warning, suggesting that the results might not be reliable. Thus, I'm running a few additional tests. 

```{r}
# non-parametric tests for main effects
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ sex, data = timepoint1)
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ genotype, data = timepoint1)
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ treatment, data = timepoint1)

# regular ANOVA despite normality violation (type 3 ss)
options(contrasts = c("contr.sum","contr.poly"))
model <- lm(weight_norm_mg ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=timepoint1)
drop1(model, .~., test="F")

options(contrasts=c("contr.treatment", "contr.poly")) # reset to default
summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=timepoint1))
# Reducing the model to significant factors
summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex + genotype + treatment + sex:genotype, data=timepoint1))
#summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ genotype * sex * treatment, data=timepoint1))
#summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ treatment * genotype * sex, data=timepoint1))
# these give slightly different result, but the same things are significant.

```

In the non-parametric tests, sex and genotype are significant.
In the regular ANOVA, sex, genotype, sex*genotype are significant.
Thus, I think the most conservative conclusion is that the sex*genotype interaction is what is important.


Run the ranked anova for the second timepoint:
```{r}
model <- art(weight_norm_mg ~ genotype*sex*treatment, data = timepoint2)
summary(model)
anova(model)
```

Again, for this dataset, the ART ANOVA gives a warning, suggesting that the results might not be reliable. Thus, I'm running a few additional tests. 

```{r}
# non-parametric tests for main effects
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ sex, data = timepoint2)
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ genotype, data = timepoint2)
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ treatment, data = timepoint2)

# regular ANOVA despite normality violation (type 3 ss)
options(contrasts = c("contr.sum","contr.poly"))
model <- lm(weight_norm_mg ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=timepoint2)
drop1(model, .~., test="F")

options(contrasts=c("contr.treatment", "contr.poly")) # reset to default
summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=timepoint2))
# Reducing factors to significant ones
summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex + genotype + treatment + sex:genotype, data=timepoint2))
#summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ genotype * sex * treatment, data=timepoint2))
#summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ treatment * genotype * sex, data=timepoint2))
# these give slightly different result, but the same things are significant.

```

In the non-parametric tests, sex and genotype are significant.
In the regular ANOVA, sex, genotype, sex*genotype are significant.
Thus, I think the most conservative conclusion is that the sex*genotype interaction is what is important. I would treat the genotype*treatment interaction with caution. 

Because we are interested in the immediate versus long-term effects, I want to also run the analyses for the 5 day and 20 day treatments separately, since timepoint 2 is an immediate effect forthe 20 day treatment and a long-term effect for the 5 day treatment. I'm also doing that for timepoint 3.
```{r}
# Subsetting
timepoint2.5d <- subset(timepoint2, (treatment == "control" | treatment == "5d"))
timepoint2.20d <- subset(timepoint2, (treatment == "control" | treatment == "20d"))

timepoint3.5d <- subset(timepoint3, (treatment == "control" | treatment == "5d"))
timepoint3.20d <- subset(timepoint3, (treatment == "control" | treatment == "20d"))

# Normality tests
shapiro.test(timepoint2.5d$weight_norm_mg) # not normal
shapiro.test(timepoint2.20d$weight_norm_mg) # not normal

shapiro.test(timepoint3.5d$weight_norm_mg) # not normal
shapiro.test(timepoint3.20d$weight_norm_mg) # not normal

#ART ANOVA
model <- art(weight_norm_mg ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint2.5d)
summary(model)
anova(model)
options(max.print = 2000)
marginal = art.con(model, "sex:genotype:treatment", adjust = "tukey")
marginal
rm(model)

model <- art(weight_norm_mg ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint2.20d)
summary(model)
anova(model)
options(max.print = 2000)
marginal = art.con(model, "sex:genotype:treatment", adjust = "tukey")
marginal
rm(model)

model <- art(weight_norm_mg ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint3.5d)
summary(model)
anova(model)
options(max.print = 2000)
marginal = art.con(model, "sex:genotype:treatment", adjust = "tukey")
marginal
rm(model)

model <- art(weight_norm_mg ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint3.20d)
summary(model)
anova(model)
options(max.print = 2000)
marginal = art.con(model, "sex:genotype:treatment", adjust = "tukey")
marginal
rm(model)

# ANOVA
summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex + genotype + treatment + sex*genotype, data=timepoint2.5d))

summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex + genotype + treatment + sex*genotype, data=timepoint2.20d))

summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex + genotype + treatment + sex*genotype, data=timepoint3.5d))

summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex + genotype + treatment + sex*genotype, data=timepoint3.20d))


```


Run the ranked anova for the third timepoint:
```{r}
model <- art(weight_norm_mg ~ genotype*sex*treatment, data = timepoint3)
summary(model)
anova(model)
```

Again, for this dataset, the ART ANOVA gives a warning, suggesting that the results might not be reliable. Thus, I'm running a few additional tests. 

```{r}
# non-parametric tests for main effects
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ sex, data = timepoint3)
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ genotype, data = timepoint3)
kruskal.test(weight_norm_mg ~ treatment, data = timepoint3)

# regular ANOVA despite normality violation (type 3 ss)
options(contrasts = c("contr.sum","contr.poly"))
model <- lm(weight_norm_mg ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=timepoint3)
drop1(model, .~., test="F")

options(contrasts=c("contr.treatment", "contr.poly")) # reset to default
summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex * genotype * treatment, data=timepoint3))
#Reducing the factors to significant ones
summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ sex + genotype + treatment + sex:genotype, data=timepoint3))
#summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ genotype * sex * treatment, data=timepoint3))
#summary(aov(weight_norm_mg ~ treatment * genotype * sex, data=timepoint3))
# these give slightly different result, but the same things are significant.

```
In the non-parametric tests, sex and genotype are significant.
In the regular ANOVA, sex, genotype, sex*genotype are significant.
Thus, I think the most conservative conclusion is that the sex*genotype interaction is what is important.

Also, for timepoint 3, the Kruskal Wallis test suggested a batch effect, which means I need to explicitly test that here as well. 

```{r}
timepoint3$set <- as.factor(timepoint3$set)
model <- art(weight_norm_mg ~ genotype*sex*treatment*set, data = timepoint3)
summary(model)
anova(model)
```
Hmmh, this is not working, and there is no information online about this specific error. In a regular ANOVA, set is not a sign. factor, so hopefully, we are ok. I think this might have to do with the fact that the design is not completely balanced. I think this is fine, but the unbalanced design also explains why Kruskal-Wallis might give a positive result - it's due to the uneven destribution of genotypes most likely. 


Generate a boxplot for the first timepoint
``` {r}
boxplot <- ggplot(data = timepoint1, aes(x = genotype, y = weight_norm_mg))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = treatment))+
  facet_wrap(c("sex"))

boxplot
```

Generate a boxplot for the second timepoint
``` {r}
boxplot <- ggplot(data = timepoint2, aes(x = genotype, y = weight_norm_mg))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = treatment))+
  facet_wrap(c("sex"))

boxplot
```

Generate a boxplot for the third timepoint
``` {r}
boxplot <- ggplot(data = timepoint3, aes(x = genotype, y = weight_norm_mg))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = treatment))+
  facet_wrap(c("sex"))

boxplot
```

Plot all timepoints together.

``` {r}
boxplot <- ggplot(data = subset(data, (treatment == "control" | treatment == "5d")), aes(x = genotype, y = weight_norm_mg))+
  geom_jitter(aes(x = genotype, y = weight_norm_mg, color = treatment, shape = treatment), position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.3))+
  facet_wrap(c("timepoint", "sex"), nrow = 3)

boxplot + scale_color_manual(values = c("#EFC000FF", "#0073C2FF"), name = "Treatment", labels = c("5-day", "Control")) + ylab("Body weight (mg)")+ xlab("Genotype")


boxplot <- ggplot(data = subset(data, (treatment == "control" | treatment == "20d")), aes(x = genotype, y = weight_norm_mg))+
  geom_jitter(aes(x = genotype, y = weight_norm_mg, color = treatment, shape = treatment), position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.3))+
  facet_wrap(c("timepoint", "sex"), nrow = 3)

boxplot + scale_color_manual(values = c("#CD534CFF","#0073C2FF"), name = "Treatment", labels = c("20-day", "Control")) + ylab("Body weight (mg)")+ xlab("Genotype")
```

#############################################
Part 3: Post-hoc


Post-hoc- investigate effects or interactions that are significant at any of the ages
```{r}

## the factor should be the factor of interest
##  "weight_norm_mg" as a character string

## specify which timepoint you are investigating 
## either timepoint1, timepoint2, or timepoint3 as an object

## set the model based on above info
model <- art(weight_norm_mg ~ sex*genotype*treatment, data = timepoint3)
anova(model)
```
Based on the significant factors in the ANOVA, use a Tukey to compare the subgroups
```{r}
options(max.print = 2000)
marginal = art.con(model, "genotype:treatment", adjust = "tukey")
marginal
```
